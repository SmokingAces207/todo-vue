Project Notes:

This is a single page application.
For this project I used NPM to manage my front end libraries.
VueJS is the front end framework of choice for this project. It is a lightweight framework, which is perfect for a small application like this.
I have decided to make use of SASS, this gives me the option to nest selectors, which creates more powerful Style Sheets.

Using the Thymeleaf templating engine for template rendering, and passing variables from the front end to the backend.

I also used the Animate CSS library to add some smooth animations to the project.

I've decided to use the Lombok library to avoid lots of extra boilerplate code, such as getters and setters. 
This helps the Entity files stay clean and easy to read.

Maven command to main run application from root:
mvn spring-boot:run

To run front end applicaition. cd into todo-view folder.
Then run : npm run dev
